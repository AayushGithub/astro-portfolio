# DreamGPT

DreamGPT is a powerful dream journaling app built with Supabase and Next.js, powered by GPT-4. It allows users to log their dreams, tag them for easy reference, and perform advanced analytics using the GPT-4 API. With DreamGPT, users can explore their dreams, gain insights, and discover patterns in their dream data.

## Features

- **Dream Logging**: Users can easily log their dreams using the DreamGPT app. They can enter details such as dream description, date, and tags to categorize their dreams.

- **Tagging and Filtering**: DreamGPT provides a tagging system to help users organize their dreams. They can assign tags to dreams and then filter and search for dreams based on specific tags or metadata.

- **Dream Notes**: Users can take notes for each dream, allowing them to jot down any additional thoughts, interpretations, or reflections related to their dreams. These notes are saved and can be accessed later for review.

- **Advanced Analytics**: DreamGPT leverages the GPT-4 API to perform analytics on the logged dream data. This powerful feature allows users to gain deeper insights into their dream patterns, emotions, themes, and more.

## Technologies Used

- **Supabase**: DreamGPT uses Supabase as the backend infrastructure for data storage and management. Supabase provides a simple and scalable solution for handling user authentication, data persistence, and real-time updates.

- **Next.js**: DreamGPT is built with Next.js, a popular React framework for building server-rendered applications. Next.js provides efficient server-side rendering, routing, and other features that enhance the performance and user experience of the app.

- **GPT-4 API**: The GPT-4 API is integrated into DreamGPT to perform advanced dream analytics. It leverages the power of the GPT-4 language model to generate insights, summarize dream data, and provide personalized recommendations based on user preferences.
