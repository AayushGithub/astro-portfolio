## Title:

Drug Eluting Device involving the use of ultra-thin, high strength, antibiotic-eluting sutures for prevention
of ophthalmic infection (1), with an emphasis on improving the reproducibility of suture manufacturing and
investigation of suture characteristics/attributes

## Summary/Introduction:

The universal use of sutures at trauma sites and widespread applications in ophthalmic surgeries lend
themselves to modulation. Modifications would allow for localized drug elution that would improve surgical and
post-operative biological outcomes. By loading antibacterial or comparable drugs directly in medium, delivery
can continue with sustained flow, and improve suture functionality (2). The method for preparation of these
specialized devices relies on electrospun nanofibers into a single, ultra-thin, multifilament suture than meets
both size and strength requirements for microsurgical ocular procedures. We aim to explore the efficacy of
standardization in manufacturing procedures and post developmental traits such as tensile strength and
binding properties/drug release rates. We are also pursuing scale manufacturing, while maintaining quality and
efficacy standards of diameter and drug release requirements.

## Main Proposal:
### **Objective:** 
Current commercially available and viable suture devices are associated with vision-threatening microbial keratitis and endophthalmitis, with complications implicated in up to 50% of infections following  penetrating keratoplasty procedures (3,4,5,6,7,8). Sutures may grow weaker in strength, come loose or even break.
Removal of such sutures after procedures such as cataract surgeries and Keratoprosthesis have shown
bacterial contamination in almost 40% of cases (9). The goal of sustenance of drug delivery along with
evaluations of ideas for improving strength is paramount, given the requirement to keep the device within the
specifications of ‘medical-grade’. A drug/antibiotic-eluting suture allows reduction in suture-related
postoperative infections and reductions in risk of infection following ocular device implantation.
The platform used here allows for execution using a method of nanostructured filaments, through the novel
electrospinning method. Such a method should be constructed to be sufficient and allow for the controlled
release of a therapeutic moiety to improve surgical outcomes. Fabrication of such fibrous sutures involves the
use of twisting drug loaded nanofibers that have been aligned through a variety of methods. The product
results to be ultra-thin, multifilament sutures of specific diameters. These diameters are determined to be
compliant and limited due to the inability of drug-loaded sutures to meet United States Pharmacopeia (U.S.P.)
standards for suture strength (10,11). This program proposal aims to standardize and improve the procedures
involved in the actual manufacturing and testing process of these sutures.

I will find a way to circumvent the shortcomings of the drug-coated suture, specifically relating to:
* Meeting diameter requirements
* Load sufficient quantities of drug, along with a variety of precursor compounds.
* Control and monitoring both short-term and long-term drug release
* Maintaining and improving scale manufacturing

The final bullet point is where most efforts will be focused. It is essential for the platform and manufacturing to
be highly versatile and controlled. All sutures and their production must abide by strict procedures of
reproducible manufacture, such that formulations, temperatures, and external factors are immune to the suture
diameter. My work also categorically deals with the effects of humidity, electrospinning spray time and twist
number. The procedures aim to be the only drug-loaded sutures that surpass U.S.P. breaking strength
specifications (12,13,14,15).

## Significance: 

Local antibacterial functionality of such drug-eluting sutures allows for their application to be
effective in cases of vulnerable surgical incision. They also provide postoperative alternatives for
noncompliance with topical antibiotic eye drops. Other than this, these devices would be beneficial in settings
of Glaucoma surgeries (trabeculectomy and use as drainage devices), Retinal detachment, vitrectomy, and
Cataract surgery (12,13,14,15).

Using the procedure of improving scale manufacturing and controlling drug
delivery, the sutures can be tested for all these settings. My study aims to improve the strength of such
devices, when produced in uncontrolled/non-favorable conditions. By testing tensile strength, suture diameter
and other USP meeting criteria at various humidity conditions, electrospinning duration and twist density, the
study aims to find the efficacy of production in mass, and underdeveloped settings.
## Methodology: 

My study is a continuation of research that is ongoing with the postdoctoral fellows involved in
the lab. The platform being utilized is changed across different combinations of unfavorable settings (high
humidity, low electrospinning times etc.). The novel manufacturing system is capable of producing and twisting
together hundreds of individual drug-loaded, polymeric nanofibers (Figure 1(a)). High voltages are applied to a
polymer or polymer/drug solution pumped at a controlled flow rate to form polymeric fibers. While conditions
are kept constant, certain characteristics are unchanged and required for USP clearance. At 1575 twists and
28 μm in diameter, multifilament PCL/8% Levo (levofloxacin) sutures surpass the minimum U.S.P. breaking
strength specification for synthetic, absorbable, 10-0-sized sutures of 0.24 N. Levo, a fluoroquinolone and
broad-spectrum ophthalmic antibiotic, is indicated for treatment of bacterial conjunctivitis. The biopolymer PCL
is also used similarly as it is capable of long-term degradation and has a history of commercial usage as
sutures (3,16,17,18,19)
. With variations in spin time and twists, we find that rotation of one collector results in the
twisting of deposited parallel fibers into a single 17-cm-long multifilament suture consistently. These fibers are
then collected in parallel between two grounded collectors situated perpendicularly to the syringe pump.
Following manufacture of sutures, along with manual twisting, drying and topical treatments, the sutures are
prepared for usage by nylon-based binding. By utilizing an inbuilt system (maintains 25% humidity levels) as
well as Dehumidifier (35% reduction of ambient humidity), humidity can be modulated and reduced such that
twist density and count can be alleviated, without compromising on breaking strength. All productions from
PCL must be comparable in both size and shape to commercially available 10-0 Ethilon® (nylon) sutures
(Figure 1(b)). For the purposes of testing, rats are used for implantation with various nylon-suture based
criteria, such as absence of postoperative care or topically administer Levo at single or multiple intervals.
Bacterial colonization would be marked by highly enflamed and/or red eyes. My study will also involve the
preparation of the rats along with observation and assistance of trained professionals to performed guided
suture implantation. Animal study would only be conducted to humidity/condition modulated sutures that are
part of groups that have undergone USP specified breaking strength testing, which will be part of my role in the
lab.
As part of my position at the lab, the process of maximizing fiber crystallinity, and consequently suture
strength, by electrospinning nanofibers composed of a lower molecular weight PCL is paramount. Conditions
must be modulated to improve polymer chain alignment and tensile strength (20) as well as maintaining USP
specifications where artificial manipulation of conditions is impossible. Furthermore, variations in drugs (high
hydrophobicity or lower degradation half-lives) can also be tested to help reduce the need for oral antibiotic
use.
## Timetable: 

My position at the lab will be directly supervised by graduate student Aditya Josyula, with
supervision and guidance from Dr. Kunal Parikh at the Center for Nanomedicine at the Wilmer Eye Institute
and Center for Bioengineering Innovation & Design, under Dr. Laura Ensign’s laboratory. Dr. Parikh has
experience with the intersection of nanomaterials, drug delivery and multi-faceted biomaterials, and will assist
me with protocols, procedures, and testing/environment modulations. During the PURA period, I will be
attending weekly lab-meetings and journal clubs held within Dr. Ensigns lab. Months 1-6 will be used for testing
combinations of unfavorable conditions (uniformly increasing humidity levels, low electrospinning times, low
twist density). Months 6-8 will be used for animal testing and burst antibiotic release studies. Months 8-10 will
be used for assessing late-stage wound sealing. Months 10-12 will be for data analysis and
abstract/manuscript preparation.

## Results:
With my investigation being a part of ongoing lab research, the results are expected to be similar in
terms of manufacturing process and general procedure. However, with alterations in experiment environments,
controllable phenomenon and even compound usage, all devices are expected to be varied in characteristics
such as tensile strength and twist diameter/density. Experiments will be repeated to allow for standardization of
manufacturing practice, and allow for suture handling, reproducibility and efficacy in vitro and vivo testing.

## Next Steps: 

Using the results and testing from the studies, the aim is to standardize the manufacturing
process and maximize reproducibility. We also aim to automate the method by the use of a unified platform in
the future once all variables have been dealt with. By optimizing compounds and processes, utilization in
unfavorable conditions (developing countries) will be possible. We plan to translate this technology platform for
patient use in ophthalmology, where passive drug release is a necessity. These results will also be compiled
as part of a separate finding. I hope to develop a manuscript and potentially attend undergraduate research
conferences.
